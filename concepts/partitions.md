# Partitions

Topic messages are keyed to produce to a single topic partition.
The file-chunk topic can have a higher number of partitions, but only one will be used using the free edition.

If tuning options are exhausted and higher throughput is desired, an enterprise edition that supports unlimited scalability using multiple tasks and multiple partitions will be available in mid-2025.
